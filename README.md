## 🌍 About the Project  

This **Taekwondo Arbitration System** is designed to provide a **low-cost digital scoring solution** for tournaments in countries where electronic scoring systems (like **Daedo**) are too expensive.  

### 🎯 Objective  
- Replace traditional **manual scorekeeping** with a **real-time digital system**  
- Enable **fair judging** without requiring electronic body protectors  
- **Free and open-source**, benefiting small Taekwondo federations  

## 🚀 Key Features  

✅ **Real-time scoring** (head kicks, body kicks, spinning techniques)  
✅ **Dual validation system** (requires two referees to confirm points)  
✅ **Kamgeon (gam-jeom) penalty tracking**  
✅ **Automatic win by point gap (12+ points)**  
✅ **Round timer with recovery periods**  
✅ **Works on any device** (laptop, tablet, or smartphone)  

## 💻 Technology Stack  

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Socket.IO  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
- **Deployment**: Render.com (free cloud hosting)  

## 📌 Why This Matters  

Many **small Taekwondo clubs** and **developing countries** cannot afford expensive electronic scoring systems. This project:  

✔ **Democratizes access** to professional arbitration tools  
✔ **Reduces human error** in scoring  
✔ **Encourages fair play** with transparent point validation
